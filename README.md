## Setup
This document describes how to run the repo using JupyterLab on Binder. It *should* be possible to run the code in JupyterLab (or another IDE) from your own machine (i.e. not on Binder), but this hasn't been tested. Follow the bullet point to install it *Locally on Windows* in [Development environment](#Development-environment) below.

All console commands are **run from the root folder of this project** unless otherwise stated.

### Start Binder instance
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/A-Breeze/premierconverter/setup?urlpath=lab)

### Development environment
The development requirements consist of the package dependencies, plus extra packages useful during development, as specified in `requirements_dev.txt`. They can be automatically installed into a conda-env as follows.
- **Binder**: A conda-env is created automatically from `binder/environment.yml` in Binder is called `notebook` by default.
- **Locally** (on Windows):
    ```
    conda env create -f binder\environment.yml --force
    conda activate premcon_dev_env
    ```

## Structure of the repo
**TODO**: Describe the structure

## Tasks
### Development installation
While developing the package, we can install it from the local code (without needing to build and then install) as follows:
```
pip install -e .
```

### Run automated tests
```
pytest tests
```

### Build package
The following will create a *source* distribution and a *wheel* distribution out of the Python package (given it includes a `setup.py`), and puts the resulting files in `build/` and `dist/` subfolders.
```
cd premierconverter
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
cd ..
```

## Further notes
### Using Binder for development
- Advantage: This will run it in the browser, so there is no prerequisite of software installed on your computer (other than a compatible browser). 
- Disadvantages:
    - Security is *not* guaranteed within Binder (as per [here](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-push-data-from-my-binder-session-back-to-my-repository)), so I'll be pushing Git from another location, which involves some manual copy-paste.
    - The package environment has to be restored each time, which takes some time.
